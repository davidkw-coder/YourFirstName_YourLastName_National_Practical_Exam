PROJECT TITLE:
Camellia HR System – Practical Exam Project

Description:
This project is a Human Resource Management System developed for Camellia Café and Catering Services, a well-known food and beverage company based in Kigali, Rwanda. The company had been using a paper-based system to manage recruitment and interview results, which caused issues like poor data security, low accessibility, and difficulty in generating reports.

This web-based system solves that problem by allowing the HR manager to register users, manage job posts, record candidates’ results, and generate reports sorted by performance.

Technologies Used:

PHP (for backend development)

MySQL (for database)

HTML and CSS (for frontend design)

Session and form validation for secure login

Prepared statements for database security

Main Features:

User Registration and Login

Secure login system using PHP sessions

Passwords are stored securely using hashing

Post Management

Add, view, edit, and delete job posts (positions like waiter, chef, etc.)

Candidate Management

Record full information about interview candidates including marks out of 100

Edit or remove candidate details

Result Reporting

Automatically sort candidates from highest to lowest marks
